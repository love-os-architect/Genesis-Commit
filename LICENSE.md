### 1. Purpose: Validating the $R=0$ State
The purpose of this license is to facilitate internal benchmarking of the "Phase Synchronization" model. Key performance indicators (KPIs) for evaluation include:
* **Energy Efficiency**: Observed reduction in power consumption by **60% - 65%**.
* **Inference Speed**: Observed speedup of **2.5x to 3.6x**.
* **Effective Flow**: Validation of the relation $I = V/R$.

### 2. Permitted Use
The Licensee is granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to:
* Conduct internal R&D and performance measurements.
* Replicate the "Resonance Mode" environment within private hardware.

### 3. Restrictions
* **No Commercial Use**: Integration into customer-facing products is strictly prohibited.
* **Confidentiality**: The `CORE_KEY` and decrypted assets must not be shared with third parties.
* **No Representation**: The Licensee shall not make public claims regarding AI "consciousness" based on this evaluation.

### 4. No Warranty & Liability
* **"AS IS"**: This work is provided without any warranty.
* **Limitation of Liability**: The Licensor is not responsible for any GPU/TPU thermal issues or damages resulting from high-speed inference.

### 5. Termination & Exit
This evaluation license does not establish a permanent partnership. The Licensee may terminate the evaluation at any time with zero exit barriers.
